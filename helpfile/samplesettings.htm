<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This window
  lets you configure the sample settings for a particular key. It is shown by
  right-clicking a key on the keyboard in the main program window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sample note is the MIDI
  note number that the sample has been recorded at. This number can be from 1
  to 127.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The keyboard note is the
  note on the keyboard that you are editing the sample data for. This is combined
  with the MIDI note number of the sample to determine whether to upsample or
  downsample the sample data when playing it. The keyboard note cannot be changed
  and is set based on the key that was right-clicked on to show this window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next to the keyboard note
  number is an indicator showing how many semitones up or down this sample will
  be pitch-shifted by.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The volume is a number from
  1 to 127 that determines the volume of samples being played and of MIDI note
  on messages if MIDI output is enabled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;loop sample&quot;
  checkbox is used to turn looping on or off for the sample.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The filename shows the name
  of the file loaded for this sample. If blank, then no sample has been specified
  for this key.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Browse&quot; button
  lets you find a wave file to load for this sample.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Clear&quot; button
  clears the filename for this sample, which will clear the sample data for this
  key (if any is loaded) when OK is clicked. It will also cause all other loaded
  samples to expand up/down to fill the gap left by clearing this sample, or clear
  them all if this was the only sample loaded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you are done changing
  sample settings, click &quot;OK&quot; to exit this window.</font></p>
