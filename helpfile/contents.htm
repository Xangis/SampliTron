    <em>A Software Sampler</em><br>
    Version 1.1</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> SampliTron is a software-based
  audio sampler with MIDI capabilities. It can be controlled via the computer
  keyboard or an external MIDI device and may also be used to control external
  MIDI devices in the same way that Proxima Controller can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most important thing
  to do before expecting to hear sound is to load one or more samples. This can
  be done by right-clicking on one of the keys on the keyboard to bring up the
  <a href="samplesettings.htm">sample settings dialog</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bank control lets you
  select which patch bank to use. This will not have any effect on the sampler
  and is only used for control of external devices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The patch control lets you
  select the patch to use. This will not have any efffect on the sampler and is
  only used for control of external devices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button showing an exclamation
  point is a &quot;panic button&quot;. Clicking this button will turn off all
  notes and reset all controllers. This can be useful if you get a stuck note
  or some bad MIDI data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button showing the letter
  &quot;i&quot; is the &quot;info button&quot;. It shows the about box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're reading this you've
  probably figured out what the button showing the question mark does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button that shows a
  MIDI connector lets you configure <a href="midisettings.htm">MIDI device settings</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button that shows a
  wrench will let you change the number of keyboard octaves displayed by the program.
  SampliTron can display from 3 to 7 octaves, with 6 being the default.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button that shows a
  disk will let you save the current sampler configuration to disk. Sampler configurations
  using samples beneath SampliTron's install directory will use relative file
  paths, while those elsewhere will store full file paths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button that shows a
  folder will let you load a sampler configuration from disk. Note that if the
  sampler configuration points to files that are not in the same location as when
  the configuration was saved, the configuration will fail to load that sample.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The left slider is the &quot;pitch
  wheel&quot;. It can be clicked and dragged up or down to raise or lower the
  pitch of any notes that are playing. When released it will return to zero position
  (center).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The right slider is the
  &quot;modulation wheel&quot;. It can be clicked and dragged up to increase the
  modulation setting. When released it will stay where it was left. When the slider
  is at the bottom of its range of travel it is considered to be at zero position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remainder of the program
  is a set of 5 octaves of keys. These can be clicked individually with the mouse
  or activated using the computer keyboard. When a note is on, the key will show
  a red dot. For keyboard control, the lowest octave is triggered by the function
  keys and each higher octave is controlled by the next row of keys, the bottom
  row being the highest octave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The keys that have samples
	configured for them will show a blue rectangle at the top of the key. Any keys
	with samples not specified will use samples from the nearest configured key for
	sound generation. If no samples are configured, SampliTron will not produce sound.</font></p>
