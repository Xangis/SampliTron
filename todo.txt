* NOTES *

- We will load the sample within the application (wxKeyboard) when the user clicks OK on the sample config dialog.
- We will resample on play -- when the user clicks on the key to play the sample.
- We will need a file format to save and load all of the sample data.  (Use Xerces as Algorhythmia does)
- We will need to be able to enable/disable MIDI output.
- Items #3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 required for 1.0 release.
